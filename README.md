Kafka Setup with Docker and Spring Boot
This guide demonstrates how to set up Apache Kafka using Docker and integrate it with a Spring Boot application. You'll learn how to send messages to a Kafka topic via a REST endpoint and consume those messages in the console.

Prerequisites
Docker installed on your machine
Java 11 or higher
Maven or Gradle
Step-by-Step Setup
1. Download and Run Kafka Docker Image
First, pull the Apache Kafka Docker image from Docker Hub and run it:

bash
Copy code
docker pull apache/kafka:3.7.1

docker run -p 9092:9092 --name kafka-server apache/kafka:3.7.1
2. Set Up Spring Boot Application
Clone the Spring Boot project or set up a new one.

3. Implement Producer and Consumer
Create services to send messages to Kafka and consume messages from Kafka.

4. Build and Run the Spring Boot Application
Build and run the Spring Boot application.

5. Test the Application
Use a tool like curl or Postman to send a message to Kafka via the /send endpoint.

Conclusion
You've now successfully set up Apache Kafka using Docker and integrated it with a Spring Boot application to send and consume messages. This setup demonstrates a basic implementation; feel free to explore and extend it based on your requirements.
